# Task-Focus
What Will You Build? 🏗️
Are you ready to dive into the world of web development and create something amazing? In this project, we’ll guide you step by step through the process of building TaskBuddy, a task management application using React. By the end of this journey, you'll have a fully functional app that not only manages tasks but also showcases your skills in modern web development.

Before we start coding, let’s take a look at the requirements and see what we will build together.

What Will You Build? 🏗️
TaskBuddy is a React-based task management application that will:

Add, delete, and mark tasks as complete: A dynamic task list that updates as you interact with it.

Persistent storage with localStorage: Your tasks will be saved even if you refresh the page.

Responsive design: The app will adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

Additional features: Filtering tasks, clearing all tasks, and validating input to ensure data integrity.

Live deployment: By the end, you’ll deploy the app to platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify, making it accessible to everyone.
